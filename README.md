  # How SynThesis Works

SynThesis is a role-based web app that streamlines the end-to-end lifecycle of university theses.    
It centralizes topic creation, student assignment, and committee formation with invitation flows.    
Students manage profiles, upload artifacts, see milestones, and track status from Active to Done.    
Professors supervise progress, record private notes, trigger “Under Examination,” and submit grades. 
Committee members collaborate transparently; peer grades are visible where policy allows.           
Examination logistics (date, time, mode, room/link) drive auto-generated presentation announcements. 
A public export endpoint delivers announcements in JSON or XML for websites and mailing lists.       
The Secretariat oversees compliance, archives outcomes, and finalizes completions across cohorts.    
A relational schema enforces referential integrity; targeted indexes keep queries fast at scale.     
Authentication and role-based authorization protect data; AJAX keeps the UI responsive and smooth.   
Overall, SynThesis reduces administrative friction, improves oversight, and unifies thesis workflows.
