SynThesis is a role-based web application that streamlines the end-to-end lifecycle of university thesis projects for Students, Professors, and the Secretariat. It centralizes topic creation, assignment, and committee formation with invitation workflows that capture accept/decline decisions and enforce one-committee-per-thesis integrity. Students manage profiles, upload drafts and supporting artifacts, register exam logistics (date, time, mode, location/link), and track status transitions from “Under Assignment” to “Active,” “Under Examination,” and “Completed.” Professors supervise progress, record short private notes, set a thesis under examination, and submit grades; committee members see peers’ grades when permitted. Secretariat users oversee active and under-examination theses, register governing-body references, and finalize completions. The system autogenerates presentation announcements from examination data and exposes them via a public export endpoint in JSON or XML for easy dissemination. A clean, responsive UI supports mobile use, while strict authentication and role-based authorization protect sensitive data. The relational schema enforces referential integrity and uses targeted indexes to keep filtering, search, and reporting fast at scale. All dynamic pages load data via AJAX to keep interactions smooth and decoupled from server templates. The application maintains an auditable trail of key actions (assignments, invitations, grading) for transparency. Overall, SynThesis reduces administrative friction, increases oversight, and delivers a unified, compliant workflow for thesis management.
